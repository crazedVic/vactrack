first time on new computer need to set up a couple of global variables

then you need to clone the repo "git clone url"

then you can go into it and type "git status" to see if it's all good

looks like "git status" doesn't detect changed files on the server, not sure how to do this yet.

then you add new files, and add them "git add ."

then you commit to local, 'git commit -m "add comment"'

then you push to server, "git push", and you'll be prompted to login

then you can pull down changes, "git pull"

need to figure out how to have computer remember my ssl key thingy so I don't have to keep logging in.
